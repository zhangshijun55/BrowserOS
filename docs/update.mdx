<Warning>
  We recently released a major update to BrowserOS. The old version is no longer supported and may cause issues with the agent. Please update to the latest version.
</Warning>

## macOS

BrowserOS on MacOS should've updated over-the-air. But you can download the latest version directly:

  After installing, you'll need to reconfigure your LLM provider settings as they won't carry over from the previous version.
