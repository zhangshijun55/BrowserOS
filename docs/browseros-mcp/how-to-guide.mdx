---

BrowserOS runs as an MCP server, letting Claude control your browser directly—open tabs, scrape data, fill forms, and more.

## How to use on Claude Code

1. Download from [BrowserOS.com](https://BrowserOS.com)
2. Open BrowserOS and open a new tab. Click the settings icon in the top right corner (see screenshot below)
3. From the settings page, navigate to **MCP** in the sidebar and copy the MCP URL
4. In your terminal, type: `claude mcp add --transport http browseros http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp` (Replace `<port>` with your port number, usually `9225`)
5. Now start Claude Code: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` (so Claude doesn't ask for confirmation each time)
6. You can now type: `Open amazon.com on browseros`

## How to add on Claude Desktop

1. Download from [BrowserOS.com](https://BrowserOS.com)
2. Open BrowserOS and click the settings icon. Navigate to **MCP** in the sidebar and note the port number (usually `9225`)
3. Open your Claude Desktop config file: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Add BrowserOS to your config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserOS": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:9225/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
Replace `9225` with your port number if different
5. Restart Claude Desktop. You should see the MCP connection indicator showing BrowserOS is connected
