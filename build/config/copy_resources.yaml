# Copy resources configuration for Nxtscape build
# This file defines all copy operations for resources during the build process
#
# Build Type Conditional Operations:
# - Use 'build_type' field to specify when an operation should run
# - Supported build types: debug, release, dev, prod
# - Operations without build_type run for all builds
# - debug/dev = development builds, release/prod = production builds
